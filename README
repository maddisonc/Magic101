Title: Magic101 (8/12/22-8/22/22)
This is my first assignment for my high school Advanced Java class.  My classmates and I brainstormed object classes that would be included in a magic/fantasy game.  We decided on three types of wizards and a dragon.  We wrote our classes independently but all agreed that the wizards should be child classes of a general, non-specific type of wizard.  This assignment required the implementation of a driver class that created our objects and a parent class.  We also had to include appropriate methods (getters/setters), constructors, and unique attributes for each child class.  (Only one commit due to our VCS issues at the beginning of the year.)
